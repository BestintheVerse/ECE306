# ECE306
Autonomous RC Car Project

This was a project done in NC State's Intro to Embedded Systems (ECE306) class. The Car source code is written for a Ti MSP430<sup>(1)</sup> for use in
IAR Embedded Systems. Additionally, RCCarControls has Android Studio source code for remote control over WiFi.

This car is controlled remotely by sending a right and left duty cycle to the wheels, values converted from a Joystick. Autonomously, the car can
follow a black line approximately 1/2" wide. 

<sup>(1)</sup> Further board clarification needed.
